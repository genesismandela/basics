Hey there!

I am Mandela and this is Basics, project made using HTML and CSS.


To make this project I use my knowledge in HTML5 using the latest elements and syntax, always tried to follow an organized structure to make it as clear as possible.

All the HTML files contains the same header structure where are filled with a navigation menu to jump into the different pages, a main heading with the topic of the page and a navigation menu to link to my social profiles.

The last HTML file is a contact form where I included information where people can contact me.


The CSS organization is not the best that I could do but when I did the project I did't know about SASS and its advantages. 

So in this project I made one CSS file for each HTML file, as well as a main stylesheet where the common things or elements that share the same style are together.

Being my real first project I am happy with the result but actually knowing that using the BEM system to name classes and the facilities that the CSS-preprocessor gives I would make many changes to make it more easy to maintain. I want to keep it like this to see far in the future how was my work and see how much my code and knowledge changes.
