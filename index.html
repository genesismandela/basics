  <!-- FIRST STAGE -->
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>
    Hey! Are you doing good today? I do not know how did you get here but you are really welcome.
    <br> Here you will see my process to become a web developer.
    <br> For the moment I am just focused learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
    <br> And meanwhile, thinking which way I will take in this long Journey.
    <br><q>Front-end, Back-end, Full stack, Data Scientist, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning... perhaps any, for now, no stress.</q>
